##Experiment with Evrythng

This experiment is showing a possible architecture to manage virtual objects for augmented reality purpose.
The idea is that a virtual object could have many attributes to define it such as shape, geolocation in real world,
functionnalities...

Using Evrythng API, Virtual Objects could be stored into a uniform layer of a virtual world.
Every virtual object could then be "seen" by using a phone camera

This project is using websockets to send data captured by a device
